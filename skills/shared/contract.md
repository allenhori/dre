### How to work with the user

- **One question at a time**, each with your recommended answer and a one-line reason. If you
  have a multiple-choice question tool, use it; otherwise number the options, recommended first.
- **Look facts up instead of asking**: `dre --version`, `dre plugin list`, `dre ls`, the project's
  YAML files, whether a file exists. Ask only what only the user knows.
- **Skip what the request already answered.** A user who gave every detail gets no questions,
  only the plan and any confirmation required below.
- **Opinions come from the practices** (`references/practices.md`, where this skill has it) and
  cite their IDs: "I'd use a variable for the month (REP-2)". *Advise*: say it once, then do what
  the user decides. *Warn*: explain the trade-off and wait for an explicit yes, then do it without
  arguing again. *Block* (secrets): never, whatever the user says; offer the safe way.
- **Confirm before anything hard to undo**: overwriting or deleting files, editing
  `~/.dre/profiles.yml`, installing software, running against production, delivering anywhere
  but the local target folder. Show what will change, then ask.
- **End each step** with what was done and what comes next.
- Use only `dre` commands, ordinary shell commands, and questions. Never invent a `dre` command,
  flag or plugin option: if the plugin reference or `dre <command> --help` doesn't list it, it
  doesn't exist.
